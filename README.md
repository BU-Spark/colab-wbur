# For this WBUR project,

Some of the codes are written by python and basic SQL. Since theres no jupyter notebooks for SQL, Below are the SQL codes that I used.

For SQL command:\
Main used:\
<b>SELECT</b> col, <b>COUNT(col)</b>\
<b> FROM </b> name_of_table\
<b>GROUP BY</b> col

<b> SELECT </b> *\
<b>FROM name_of_table </b>

Filtering:

<b> SELECT </b> col\
<b>WHERE col = (something) </b>\
<b> FROM </b> name_of_table
