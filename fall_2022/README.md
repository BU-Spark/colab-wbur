# xc410-dara-process

This is a repository to record the method of how to clean and process the data.
And other miscellaneous stuff

## Import data

Currently we are interested in the `cases_masscourts_org` table inside `civica_courtdocs` database.
The current operation is on a subset of the original data (20,000 rows out of 3,000,000 rows).

SQL to get the sample data: `SELECT * FROM civica_courtdocs.cases_masscourts_org LIMIT 20000`. And the sample data is stored in CSV format locally.

TODO:
1. Better format to store and process the data locally?
2. How to query the entire table.
